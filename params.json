Ironically, the absence of those I refer to\r\nwould all but guarantee this outcome!\r\nI of course refer here to the constants of the physical world:\r\n\r\n**G**, the gravitational constant, whose vigilance secures us to this very world;\r\n\r\n**O**, oops;\r\n\r\n**D**,electric displacement field,also called the electric flux density;\r\n\r\n**P**,kilogram meter per second (kg m/s);\r\n\r\n**A**,area;\r\n\r\n**P**,pascal (Pa);\r\n\r\n**E**,the electric constant, which gives rise to the properties of the electromagnetic fields our technology depends upon;\r\n\r\n**R**,Electrical resistance;\r\n\r\n# Games under \"GODPAPER\" framework\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v331\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v331</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v801648\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v801648</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v317464\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v317464</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v93665\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v93665</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v977037\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v977037</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v687814\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v687814</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v776899\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v776899</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/the-color-lines\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/the-color-lines</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v312167\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v312167</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v744572\">https://www.mochimedia.com/games/play/_v744572</a>\r\n\r\n# Main features\r\nThis wiki is for programmers. More precisely, it’s for programmers who favor the “learn by example” approach.\r\nI don’t know about you, but I’ve ready plenty of flash games where all they present are fragments of applications and small, contrived bits of code to illustrate a given point. Now, without question, that is sometimes precisely what you want. Oftentimes, however, what you really want is a whole application that is explained in its entirety so you can see how all the pieces fit together as you explore it little by little. This is precisely what this wiki seeks to do.\r\n\r\n# GODPAPER Roadmap\r\n\r\n## Current Releases\r\n\r\n**TheRealKnight 1.0.0**(Work in progress...)\r\n\r\n*Good-Old-Fashioned-AI*\r\n\r\nUninformed Search\r\nSimulated evolution\r\n\r\n*Simplicity of Flex application*\r\n\r\nMxml application,\r\nGreen thread,\r\nCross plant-form deployment \r\n\r\n## Future Releases\r\n\r\n**TheRealKnight 2.0(TheKnightErrant)**\r\n\r\nWhat-if:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.godpaper.com/godpaper/images/1/1d/GodpaperFacts.png\">http://www.godpaper.com/godpaper/images/1/1d/GodpaperFacts.png</a>\r\n\r\nWork in progress:\r\n\r\nPerformance enhancement(Starling,Stage3d)\r\n\r\n*Strong AI*\r\n\r\nInformed Search\r\n\r\nKnowledge Representation\r\n\r\nEvolutionary Computation\r\n\r\nNeural Networks I\r\n\r\nIntelligent Agents\r\n\r\n## Future areas of investigation, not scheduled yet.\r\n\r\nNeural Networks II\r\n\r\nBiologically Inspired\r\n\r\nHybrid Models\r\n\r\n# Tutorials\r\nSee:<a href=\"http://blog.lookbackon.com/?p=2469\">http://blog.lookbackon.com/?p=2469</a>\r\n# Downloads\r\nLink(TheRealKnight for FLEX4):<a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/godpaper/downloads/list\">http://code.google.com/p/godpaper/downloads/list</a>\r\n# Q & A \r\nSee:<a href=\"http://www.lookbackon.com/qa/\">http://www.lookbackon.com/qa/</a>\r\n# More\r\nSee:<a href=\"http://www.godpaper.com/godpaper/index.php/Framework\">http://www.godpaper.com/godpaper/index.php/Framework</a>\r\n","name":"Godpaper","tagline":"A flash/objective-c board game framework who named \"the real knight/the real bishop\".","google":""}
